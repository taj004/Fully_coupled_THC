This repository contains the run scripts for the paper "Simulation of reactive transport in fractured porous media" by Shin Irgens Banshoya, Inga Berre and Eirik Keilegavlen (all at Dept. of Mathematics, UiB).

The implementation uses version 1.5.0 of PorePy. Additionally, some functionalities were modified. To get these, pull the branch modified_discretization_matrices, commit dd37db2c9c403ba9d0eca734eacfc40031bbac02.
